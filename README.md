# Hangman-Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game, a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. 
In this game, one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. 
Each incorrect guess results in part of a hangman being drawn.
